## 🚀 Overview

Developed a **full-stack real-time chat application** using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **Socket.io** for seamless, bi-directional messaging between multiple users. This project showcases my ability to integrate real-time data with dynamic front-end design, all while maintaining efficient back-end communication and storage.

## 🛠 Key Features

- **Real-time Communication**: Utilized **Socket.io** for real-time messaging between clients.
- **Dynamic UI**: Designed with **EJS templates**, **HTML**, and **CSS** for a responsive user experience.
- **MongoDB Integration**: User messages and chat data are stored using **MongoDB** and **Mongoose** for easy retrieval and scalability.
- **WebSocket Communication**: Configured efficient WebSocket routes to handle multiple users in real-time.

## 🔧 Project Architecture

The project is organized as follows:

```bash
📦chat-app
 ┣ 📂config
 ┃ ┗ 📜database-config.js
 ┣ 📂models
 ┃ ┗ 📜chat.js
 ┣ 📂public
 ┃ ┗ 📜script.js
 ┣ 📂views
 ┃ ┗ 📜index.ejs
 ┣ 📜package.json
 ┗ 📜index.js
```

## 🔧 Key File Descriptions

- **config/database-config.js**: MongoDB configuration to connect the database.
- **models/chat.js**: Mongoose schema for storing chat data.
- **public/script.js**: Client-side JavaScript for WebSocket communication.
- **views/index.ejs**: EJS template for the chat interface.
- **index.js**: Server-side logic to handle real-time messaging.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Socket.io** initializes the real-time connection between clients and the server.
2. **Express.js** handles the routing and middleware setup.
3. **MongoDB** stores chat logs and user interactions efficiently.
4. **WebSocket** ensures messages are sent and received instantly.
